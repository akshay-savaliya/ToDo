_Last updated: May 30, 2025_

ToDo is a task management application developed by Akshay Savaliya to help users stay organized. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how we handle your data.

## 1. Information Collection

We do **not** collect any personally identifiable information. All data, including your tasks and preferences, is stored **locally on your device**.

## 2. Data Usage

The app uses local storage (Room Database and DataStore) to save:
- Your to-do list items
- Your theme preference (light/dark mode)

We do not transmit or share this data with any server or third party.

## 3. Permissions

ToDo may request basic permissions such as:
- **Internet access**: Only for app updates (no data sent)

## 4. Third-party Services

This app does **not** use third-party SDKs, analytics tools, or ad networks.

## 5. Security

Since all data is stored locally, your task information remains private and secure on your device.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy occasionally. Updates will be posted here with a new effective date.
